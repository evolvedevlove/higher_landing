# Code is Poetry 
A jumble of words with required intent,
that never tells one story one hundred percent.
A bundle of jargon - formatted in chunks.
Lines and lines stacked up like bunks.
The meaning is clear if you know the intention:
That which runs or halts in suspension
is only a yes or no, and is worth the inspection.
